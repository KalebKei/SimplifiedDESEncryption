# SimplifiedDESEncryption
Simplified DES Encryption algorithm originally intended for a software security course at Ohio University.




## TODO
- Find a better way to implement converting to binary arrays (bit shifting?)
- Implement Permutations up to key generation
- Implement Key gen
- Implement permutations after key generation
- Confirm all logic flows
- Profit
